# chatgpt-whatsapp
This repository contains code that demonstrates how to integrate Cloud Function (GCP) with Twilio to establish a connection between ChatGPT and WhatsApp. The fn.go code provided in this repository is intended to be used as the code for the Cloud Function. This integration aims to provide a practical example of how to use Twilio to connect to ChatGPT via WhatsApp, thereby exploring its functionalities in a real-world scenario. The objective of this project is to showcase the potential of integrating ChatGPT with various messaging platforms using Twilio.

To get started with this integration, replace <API KEY> in the fn.go file with your ChatGPT API key. Once the Cloud Function is deployed on GCP, configure the Twilio sandbox to use the Cloud Function's URL as the webhook for incoming messages. ChatGPT will now be able to receive incoming messages from WhatsApp and respond accordingly.

If you encounter any issues with this integration, feel free to open an issue in this repository or refer to the documentation provided by Twilio and ChatGPT.

We hope that this integration serves as a helpful resource for those looking to connect ChatGPT with other messaging platforms. Let's continue to explore the capabilities of natural language processing and its applications in the real world!
